The Futility project is a CMake-configurable package of FORTRAN utilities that
contains the following capabilities:
- Definition of kinds for intrinsic numeric data types
- Unit test harness
- Definitions for some basic extensions to the Fortran language:
 - arbitrary length strings, a parameter list construct, exception handlers,
   a command line processor, and timers
- Geometry definitions and intersection routines for:
 - point, line, plane, box, cylinder, and polyhedron
- File wrapper functions:
 - standard Fortran input/output files, binary files, HDF5 files, and VTK files
- Parallel wrapper functions:
 - MPI, and OpenMP abstraction layers, partitioning algorithms
- Math utilities:
 - BLAS, Matrix and Vector definitions, Linear Solver methods, wrappers for
   other TPLs (PETSC, MKL, etc), and pre-conditioner classes,
- A lightweight profiling interface, and
- Other miscellaneous routines:
 - random number generator, water saturation properties, sorting algorithms

The Futility project will not contain any encryption technology to preserve the
  open source license.

The original software package that is now Futility was developed at the
   University of Michigan to enable efficient development and testing of the
   MPACT code. The original developers, now at ORNL and Michigan, further
   extended this library and generalized it for use with COBRA-TF and MAMBA as
   part of VERA. Further information on these original applications that
   leverage Futility can be found at www.casl.gov.
